Set 2
There is a N*N integer matrix Arr[N][N]. From the row r and column c, we can go to any of the following three indices:

I.                Arr[ r+1 ][ c-1 ] (valid only if c-1>=0)

II.               Arr[ r+1 ][ c ]

III.              Arr[ r+1 ][ c+1 ] (valid only if c+1<=N-1)

So if we start at any column index on row 0, what is the largest sum of any of the paths till row N-1.

Set 2

Two robots land with their parachutes on an infinite one-dimensional number line. They both release their parachutes as soon as they land and start moving. They are allowed only to make use of the following functions.

I.                 moveLeft() // robot moves to left by 1 unit in 1 unit time

II.               moveRight() // robot moves to right by 1 unit in 1 unit time

III.              noOperation() // robot does not move and takes 1 unit time

IV.              onTopOfParachute() // returns true if the robot is standing on top of either of the parachute, else false

V.               didWeMeet() // returns true if the robot meets to the other robot, else false
